# Tic-Tac-Toe

This Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game in which both opponents are trying to get 3 in a row (of X's or O's). The game is played on a 3x3 grid with whoever is up displayed in the bottom right corner. Made a mistake? One can restart simply by pressing the clear button on the right hand side.
